==== High Priority ====
* Change serialization format from pickle to JSON 
* Support [ignore] keyword for commits that shouldn't show up in patch notes
* Create Miscellaneous section of patch notes for unrecognized message formats
* Store author of a commit
* Support new audio & art commits
* Preserve logfiles
* Record ALL commits that weren't included in patch notes somewhere so we
	can notice when there might be issues with the error catching/parsing
* Actually write useful information about parsing process to the logfile


==== Edge Cases & Testing ====
* Handle merge commits
* Filter out commits that have already been seen
* If patch notes file already exist, append new patch notes to existing list
		* probably just unpickle and then combine the dictionaries(?)
