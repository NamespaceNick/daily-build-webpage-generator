Readme for Studio autobuilding

## How it works
This repo handles the creation and maintenence of the webpage that contains our
daily builds for WolverineSoft Studio game projects. There are 3 main
components to this process:
1. Categorizing and recording any new commits since the creation of the last
daily build.
2. Generating patch notes based on the above fresh commits.
3. Updating the daily builds webpage (and directory structure) to include the
new build & patch notes
